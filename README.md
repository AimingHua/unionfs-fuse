unionfs-fuse
============

This is my effort to create a unionfs filesystem implementation which is way more
flexible than the current in-kernel unionfs solution.

I'm open to patches, suggestions, whatever...

The preferred way is the mailing list at unionfs-fuse (at) googlegroups (dot) com
or see unionfs-fuse on Google Groups.
