\fB[\-o \fIoption1\fP \-o \fIoption2\fP ... \-o \fIoptionN\fP ]\fR
             \fBtop_branch:lower_branch:...:lowest_branch \fR
             \fBmount_point\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBunionfs\-fuse\fR overlays several directory into one single mount point.
.PP 
It first tries to access the file on the top branch and if the file does not exist
there, it continues on lower level branches.
If the user tries to modify a file on a lower level read\-only branch
the file is copied to to a higher level read\-write branch if the 
\fBcopy\-on\-write (cow) \fR mode was enabled.
.SH "OPTIONS"
Below is a summary of unionfs\-fuse options
.TP 
\fB\-o cow
Enable copy\-on\-write
.TP 
\fB\-o stats
Show statistics in the file 'stats' under the mountpoint.
.TP 
\fB\-o noinitgroups

supplementary user groups, but will cause a deadlock of unions 
including /etc.
